A python executable meant to take a number of mutants (X) where X can be between 1-9 and a filename to produce X new source files from the seed file.

In order to execute the program, use the following format in command line:

python mutate.py <FILENAME> <NUMBER_OF_MUTATIONS>

for example "python mutate.py Agent.py 9" will make 9 mutations of the "Agent.py" file.
